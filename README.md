# Smooth Migration App
Prototype App created for [Smooth Migration](https://smoothmigration.net/) as a way to showcase
ideas in **user authentication**, **task tracking**, and **AI involvement in task generation and further
questions** when needed.  We also used this to try out some further "extra" ideas we thought would
be interesting to implement for the app, involving **notes on each task**, the ability to get **markdown
as your response from the chatbot**, and **pop-up task information** for those notes and "ask for help" sections.

For a longer demo video, here's the link to an unlisted YouTube video showcasing the final submission in terms
of being an **Android** app, though the app was usable as **Web** and **Apple** versions:

Then here's a shorter video showcasing the web version:

## Description
This app is designed to provide services for migration as provided by the company Smooth Migration.
Users can also take a more in-depth questionnaire about their move to be able to use AI to generate a personalized checklist.
Users are also able to ask an AI chatbot about their move and specific tasks to get more information, with responses returned
in formatted markdown.
